 * Tamil language-quality layer: one model call per action (no rewrite loops, so cost stays predictable), followed by
 * deterministic checks that catch the failures a grammar tool must never have: dropped dates/amounts/names, an answer that
 * is not Tamil, runaway length (invented content), and chatter around the answer. A result that fails a check is rejected
 * and the caller keeps the original text. Meaning-preservation beyond these checks is the model's job and is NOT verified here.
